# Read(about)Me

# Availability
I try and be as responsive as possible to any communication, although to to response are typically ranked by medium:

1. Face to face
2. Paging
3. Slack
4. SMS/phone/none work related messaging platforms.
5. Email

An email to me does not guarantee a timely response. I receive a lot of email and I treat it as an asynchronus medium. If your query requires data I don't have to hand, it may to a while to respond. If you feel like I am ignoring an email, feel free to use the others. Please use SMS (and dare I say phoning) for special cases. I prefer my work communications to be on 1,3 or 5.

## Out of hours communications
Unless there is an emergency I can't guarantee I will respond until the next working day. If I contact you, I don't expect that you do the same. If there is an emergency, feel free to Page me. If I contact you in an emergency, (e.g. production system down) I expect you to care enough.

# 1:1s
I want to make these valuable but they are your meetings. If you have an agenda item please bring it up. This is your chance to talk. We will have scheduled 1:1s but if you want to talk ad-hoc, Slack me and I will find time.

# Caring

- Making our product better
- Making our team better
- Making you better
- Making me better

If we aren't in a sustained cycle of learning, let's change that. Talk to me.  *Help me*. If you don't care then you won't fit on our team.

# I trust you
Yes, if you are on my team, my default is to trust that you have the tools to do the job in hand. I trust you to keep our systems up and lift our team and products to new heights. I you need anything to help you achieve that goal, let's talk.

# I am human
Which means I inevitably falter. The things written above are part of my guiding principles. If you feel like our team is not adhering to these
